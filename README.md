# Load tester

This project is a custom-built load testing tool, thoughtfully designed to meet specific requirements and use cases. It supports custom YAML configurations, enabling a declarative approach tailored for cloud-native deployments and testing scenarios, including Kubernetes workloads. The tool dynamically simulates traffic patterns to enable realistic and controlled testing. Metrics can be exported to external tools like Prometheus, facilitating centralized monitoring and management.
